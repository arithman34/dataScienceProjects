# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and expertise in the field of Data Science. Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on, including SQL projects, Tableau resource files, and other large-scale Data Science projects. Feel free to explore the folders to learn more about each project.

## SQL Projects

In the `SQL` folder, you'll find various SQL projects that demonstrate my proficiency in working with relational databases, querying data, and extracting valuable insights. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with details about the project, data sources, and the queries used for analysis.

## Tableau Visualizations

The `Tableau` folder contains resource files related to Tableau visualizations I have created. You can find Tableau workbooks that showcase my ability to transform raw data into interactive and informative visualisations at my Tableau public page. Please refer to the README files in each directory for specific details about the visualizations and the data they represent.

## Large-Scale Data Science Projects

In the `Projects` folder, you'll find larger-scale Data Science projects that cover various aspects of the data lifecycle. These projects demonstrate my skills in data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and more. Each project has its own directory with a detailed README file, providing insights into the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings.
